In Today’s world Sensitive data is shared over the internet. The ever increasing internet resulted in
even more dependancy on the internet. As the technology expands, it raises the concerns of various
cyber threats. Personal data is more vulnerable these days due to all being easily accessible from the
social media. Sensitive data is now being stored on cloud and over 40 billions messages are sent in
a day. These message may contain sensitive data and are prone to leaking. Cloud computing is the
most rapidly growing industry in today’s time. It is very important to know the need for cloud
computing, so let’s take an example you want to host a website there are following things you need
to do like buy a stack of servers , keep peak traffic in mind , monitoring and maintenance of your
servers. Few disadvantages of the setup that is without cloud computing like the setup is very
expensive because we have to buy the setup on our own , troubleshooting problems can be very
tiring and may affect with your business goals like if there is someone who would just maintain the
servers then you can focus on your main business goals. In order to protect all this data from being
stolen and misused cryptography is used. Cryptography is a technique used for protecting sensitive
information and personal data with the help of various cryptographic techniques. Cryptography is
used by billions of people around the globe, although it mostly goes unnoticed. In this paper we
have discussed about various cryptographic techniques i.e. Diffie-Hellman Algorithm, DES
Algorithm AES Algorithm, uses of asymmetric and symmetric keys, various ciphers including
substitution and transposition cipher to securely transfer data.
